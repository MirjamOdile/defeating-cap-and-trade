She is also on the boards of a number of major Swiss and German companies. She has also done work for radio, television, newspapers and magazines, and has received a number of awards. [3]\\nShe studied literature and art history in Bonn, Berlin, Zurich and Mannheim from 1960 to 1966. She attained a Doctorate (Dr. phil.) at the University of Mannheim. From 1972 to 1993 she was a professor of German studies and General Literature at the University of Paderborn. She was later elected to the University Council of the University of Paderborn, but was forced to resign from this position after the allegation that she had deliberately rented offices to a state representative of the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany). [4], [5], [6], [7]\\nHöhler has held a number of other positions, including public relations consulting for Dr. Alfred Herrhausen and as CEO of Deutsche Bank AG from 1987 to 1990. From 1992 to 1995 she was the Non-executive Director at the British food conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC. Between 1997 and 2008, Gertrud was Director of CIBA Specialty Chemicals, Basel. She has also been director of Baloise Insurance since 1998, and a Director of Georg Fischer AG, Schaffhausen. [1]\\nCIBA Specialty Chemicals is a chemical company based in Basel, Switzerland. CIBA stood for “Chemische Industrie Basel” or Chemical Industries Basel, and was originally formed as the non-pharmaceutical element of Novartis. In 2008, CIBA was taken over by the German Chemical company BASF and eventually renamed BASF Schweiz AG. Höhler ended her term as director (PDF) in the same year.

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Tony Abbott was Prime Minister of Australia between 2013 and 2015, having led the centre-right Liberal Party in opposition since 2009. He was ousted as Liberal Party leader by Malcolm Turnbull in September 2015 following poor approval ratings. [1], [3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other political roles he has held include Minister for Women, Leader of the House and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Abbott lost his parliamentary seat in the 2019 elections to an independent candidate who “campaigned strongly on a platform of climate change”, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. [1], [4]\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott has historically opposed measures to combat climate change, advocating for the (ultimately successful) repeal of Australia's carbon tax in 2014, introduced by the previous Labor government. In 2009, Abbott resigned from the shadow cabinet of Malcolm Turnbull, in protest at Turnbull's support for the government's proposed emissions trading scheme. The resignation of Abbott and a number of other shadow ministers led to a leadership contest that Abbott won by a single vote. [5], [6]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, he gave a lecture entitled “Daring to Doubt” to the UK-based climate science denial group the Global Warming Policy Foundation, following in the footsteps of fellow Australian PM John Howard. [7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott has close ties to the influential right-wing thinktank, the Institute of Public Affairs, which has regularly invited him to give speeches. In 2013, the group published a series of policy recommendations to abolish climate measures, several of which were adopted by Abbott's government in September of that year. [8], [9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott began his career as a journalist for The Bulletin and The Australian, as well as briefly managing a concrete factory. He later became press secretary and political adviser to Liberal Party opposition leader John Hewson. [10]\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately before being elected as an MP for Warringah in 1994, Abbott worked as the first Executive Secretary of the Australians for Constitutional Monarchy group, which works to “preserve, protect and defend the Australian Constitution, the role of the Crown in it, and our National Flag”. [11]\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2020, Abbott was appointed to the Government’s “Board of Trade,” advising Secretary of State Liz Truss on the negotiation of new agreements with countries such as Australia. [21]\n",

      "Stance on Climate Change\n",
      "\n",
      "October 9, 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 2017 lecture Abbott gave to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, he said: [7]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott also said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“At least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm. Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide – which is a plant food after all – are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At another point in his speech he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased.” [7]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "September 1, 2013\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about his views on climate change during an appearance on ABC's Insiders show, Abbott said: [12]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that climate change is real, humanity makes a contribution. It's important to take strong and effective action against it, and that is what our direct action policy does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The important thing is to take strong and effective action to tackle climate change, action that doesn't damage our economy. And that is why the incentive-based system that we've got, the direct action policies, which are quite similar to those that president Obama has put into practice, is – that's the smart way to deal with this, a big tax is a dumb way to deal with it.” [12]\n",

      "Abbott appeared on an Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation radio show in which he said: [13]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“While we still seem to be in the grip of a climate cult, the climate cult is going to produce policy outcomes that will cause people to wake up to themselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said during the interview:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The last thing we should do is drive our industries offshore and be putting pressure on household budgets and risk third world-style blackouts all in the name of climate change. We have got to be sensible and balanced and proportionate about these things and I don’t think other policymakers are right now.” [13]\n",

      "\n",
      "July 3, 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "In a speech to the climate science denial group the Australian Environment Foundation, Abbott called for Australia to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and incorrectly said: [14]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Storms are not more severe; droughts are not more prolonged; floods are not greater; and fires are not more intense than a century ago – despite hyperventilating reportage and over-the-top claims from Green politicians.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sea levels have hardly risen and temperatures are still below those of the medieval warm period. Over time, temperature change seems to correlate rather more with sun spot activity than with carbon dioxide levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And even if carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring trace gas that’s necessary for life, really is the main climate change villain, Australia’s contribution to mankind’s emissions is scarcely more than 1%.” [14]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The AEF was established by the right-wing Institute of Public Affairs thinktank in 2005 and has campaigned against carbon pricing and wind energy. [15]\n",

      "\n",
      "Abbott was appointed to the Government’s “Board of Trade,” advising Secretary of State Liz Truss on the negotiation of new agreements with countries such as Australia. His appointment came despite widespread concern over his record on women’s and LGBT+ rights and climate science denial. [21]\n",
      "\n",
      "June 27, 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott gave a speech to the Institute of Policy Affairs in which he “called on the Coalition to focus intently on cost of living pressures and renewed his attack on the renewable energy target, blaming it for making gas and coal unaffordable”, according to a report by ABC. He also rejected a proposed clean energy target and said a new coal-fired power station should be built as soon as possible, with government funding if necessary. [8]\n",
      "\n",
      "January 29, 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott called for Australia's renewable energy target to be scrapped in a speech to a Young Liberals conference, claiming it would destroy heavy industry in South Australia due to rising electricity costs, ABC reported. The policy was defended by the Energy Minister as “moderate” compared to a Labor Party proposal. [16]\n",

      "July 12, 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott's government announced its plans to ban the government-backed Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) from investing in existing wind technology as well as small-scale solar projects. [17]\n",
      "\n",
      "June 10, 2015\n",
      "\n",
      "Abbott appeared on radio host Alan Jones' show during which he said he thought wind farms were “visually awful” and could have “potential health impacts”. [18]\n",

      "December 1, 2009\n",
      "\n",
      "After defeating Liberal Party leader Malcolm Turnbull in a leadership contest, Abbott conducted a secret ballot among Liberal MPs and Senators on the government's proposed emissions trading scheme.

      "October 9, 2013\n",

      "DeSmog revealed that Abbott had surrounded himself with a number of advisers who reject mainstream climate science. They included Maurice Newman, who has described climate change as a “smokescreen” for “vested interests” and Nick Minchin, who played a key role in helping Abbott oust Malcolm Turnbull in 2009.

      "\n",
      "The charity was founded in 2004 to fight against what it described as the “grotesque political push” for wind energy in the UK, with TV presenter Noel Edmonds originally serving as its chairman. Edmonds said at the time that he joined the group because of the threat of wind farm developments near his home in Devon. [4]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2008, it was the subject of a complaint relating to its campaigning activities which led to a meeting with the Charity Commission to “discuss amending its objects to accurately reflect the charity's activities and purposes,” according to a Charity Commission spokesperson. [3]\n",

      "Michael Kelly serves as Chairman of the REF. Kelly is a retired Cambridge University engineering professor who is also a trustee of the UK's principal climate science denial group the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). He has previously spoken of having a “principled climate science scepticism” and gave the charity's annual lecture in 2019. According to a press release about the event, Kelly argued the UK's recently adopted 2050 “net zero” emissions target was “beset by superficial thinking that ignores engineering reality” and would be “unachievable without major social disruption”. He has frequently cast doubt on the ability of renewables to meet future energy needs and has wrongly claimed that climate models have been “heating twice as fast as the data”. [8], [9], [10], [11]\n",
      "\n",
      "John Constable was previously Director of Policy and Research at the REF and still acts as a spokesperson for the group, as well as being a director of the Renewable Energy Forum. In addition, Constable is the Energy Editor of the Global Warming Policy Forum, campaign arm of the GWPF. Constable was previously registered as a member of staff for a fellow GWPF advisor, Viscount Matt Ridley, from June 2017, giving him access to the House of Lords. Constable has been a vocal critic of government energy policy and has long opposed subsidies for renewable energy. He was chairman of a local anti-wind farm campaign group called NOWAP until it was dissolved in 2014.  [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]\n",

      "Carol Bell is a trustee of the REF and a board member of the government-backed Development Bank of Wales, as well as a Council Member of Cardiff University. She has spent much of her career working in the oil and gas sector and banking. She is currently Non-Executive Director of TransGlobe Energy, an oil company; Tharisa plc, a mining company; Bonheur ASA, a holdings company involved in renewables, oil and gas, and shipping; and the BlackRock Energy and Resources Investment Trust, which invests heavily in coal, oil and gas. Bell was formerly Managing Director of the Global Oil & Gas Group at the Chase Manhattan Bank. She also holds a PhD in Archaeology and is Vice President of the National Museum of Wales. Bell is a founding member of Chapter Zero, a forum for company board members to engage with the issue of climate change. In 2017, she was revealed to have been vetoed by the Welsh Government as the Wales representative on the BBC's board, having been then Culture Secretary Karen Bradley's preferred candidate.

      "Colin Davie is a trustee and secretary of the REF, as well as a director of the Renewable Energy Forum. He is also a Conservative councillor in Lincolnshire, holding a role on the county council as an Executive Councillor for Economy and Place. Davie is a director of Investors in Lincoln, a local property development company. He has been a long-time opponent of wind farm developments in the area, claiming in 2012 that they were “one of the least efficient ways of producing electricity” and calling on the council to “resist the creation of any new wind farms in the county”. At the time, Davie was chairman of the council's Environmental Scrutiny Committee. In 2015, he celebrated the news that a wind project had been cancelled and the following year said he was “extremely disappointed” about the construction of a substation in Lincolnshire to service an offshore wind farm. Davie campaigned for the UK to leave the European Union and has said a “no-deal Brexit” presents a “low risk” to businesses in his region. [8], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [33], [34]\n",

It was purchased in 2009 by Specmat, one of Smith’s technology manufacturing companies. While he keeps a low profile, Smith is perhaps best known for flying former Prime Minister David Cameron to his home in Shobdon, Herefordshire, in 2007.

      "The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) exists to combat what it describes as “extremely damaging and harmful policies” designed to mitigate climate change and regularly publishes reports rejecting the scientific consensus on the issue. It was founded in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 by former Conservative Chancellor Lord Nigel Lawson. Several of the GWPF's members and funders are affiliated with other groups located at 55 Tufton Street. [1], [3]\n",

      "Civitas is an educational charity and publisher specializing in health, education, welfare, and economics. The thinktank has published reports arguing against policies to tackle climate change, including a 2013 report by current Energy Editor of the GWPF John Constable. It claimed a shift to renewable energy would mean “more people would be working for lower wages in the energy sector, energy costs would rise, the economy would stagnate, and there would be a significant decline in the standard of living”. Sir Alan Rudge, an advisor to the GWPF, and Lord Nigel Vinson, a GWPF funder, are both trustees. The group has been criticised by Transparify for its “opaque” operations. [4], [45], [5], [6], [3], [7]\n",
      "\n",
      "The TaxPayers’ Alliance is a free-market pressure group and thinktank formed in 2004 by Matthew Elliott to campaign for a low tax society. It advocates the removal of various measures designed to reduce emissions, including the Climate Change Levy. In 2016 the TaxPayers’ Alliance, along with US climate science denying lobby groups the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and the Heritage Foundation, held a free trade event at the Conservative Party Conference. The group was, as of November 2015, a member of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a climate science denial umbrella group run by the CEI, but is no longer listed on its website. The Taxpayers' Alliance belongs to an international coalition of anti-tax, free-market campaign groups called the World Taxpayers Associations. Other members include the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance, Americans for Tax Reform, the Austrian Economics Center and the Canadian Taxpayers' Federation. [8], [9], [10], [35]\n",

According to the ConservativeHome blog, Matthew Elliott serves as an advisor to the forum, while Michael Gove, former UK Environment Secretary, has spoken at its events. Its founder and Director is Peter Whittle, former UKIP leader in the London Assembly and former Culture and Communities Spokesperson (2014-2018) and Deputy Leader (2016-2017) for the party.

      "Vote Leave was the official pro-Brexit campaign. The group was originally a resident of 55 Tufton Street but moved to a bigger office several months before the referendum. Members included Nigel Lawson, Matthew Elliott, Graham Stringer (also a GWPF trustee), Matt Ridley, along with prominent Conservative Party politicians Andrea Leadsom, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. GWPF and Tory donor Michael Hintze also donated to Vote Leave. [2], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]\n",
      "\n",
      "UK2020 was a right-wing thinktank set up by former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson in 2014 that drew comparisons with the American “Tea Party” movement. Among the policy recommendations the group called for was “a robust, common sense energy policy that would encourage the market to choose affordable technologies to reduce emissions.” These technologies include shale gas and small modular nuclear reactors. It also aimed to strip back regulations and subsidies in the energy sector designed to combat climate change. Matt Ridley of the GWPF was a policy advisor for UK2020 and Tim Montgomerie, founder of the ConservativeHome website and a former senior fellow at the Legatum Institute, was their political adviser. [23], [24], [2], [36]\n",

      "Leave Means Leave was a pro-Brexit campaign group formed following the 2016 EU referendum to “ensure the UK makes a swift, clean exit from the EU”. It backed a “hard” Brexit, with the UK leaving the European Single Market, the Customs Union and the European Court of Justice, and supported the UK reverting to World Trade Organisation rules. The group was co-founded by Richard Tice, a property developer and now Chair of the Brexit Party, and John Longworth, former Director-General of the British Chamber of Commerce and now Executive Director of the Centre for Brexit Policy. Its advisory board included MPs Sammy Wilson, Owen Paterson, Graham Stringer, Kate Hoey and Peter Bone. On a now-deleted page on the group's website, Nigel Farage was listed as its Vice-Chair, along with Tice. The group ceased to operate on January 31, 2020, the day Britain left the EU, with its website stating that it had “achieved its aims.”  A telephone number previously used by the group is in use as the contact number for the Economists for Free Trade (EFT) and the Centre for Brexit Policy (CBP) and has been linked to the office of Media Intelligence Partners. [49], [50], [51], [52], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72]\n",

In 2014, it released a briefing paper on ‘Energy Policy and the EU’, claiming that EU regulations and policy had driven up the cost of energy in the UK and recommending that the government should consider opting out of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Matt Ridley, an advisor to the GWPF, launched the Business for Britain North East branch, and Lord Vinson acted as an advisor to the group. Founder Matthew Elliott announced the group's closure in September 2016.  [11], [12], [13], [37], [79]\n",

      "The European Foundation was a high-profile Eurosceptic thinktank formed in 1993 to oppose the Maastricht Treaty and chaired by Conservative MP Bill Cash. The group published a report in 2009 during the Copenhagen climate summit entitled “100 reasons why global warming is natural” which denied there is any proof that human influence has anything to do with climate change. Members of the group’s advisory board included Matthew Elliott, Richard Smith, owner of 55 Tufton Street, the former UKIP MEP Roger Helmer, and Conservative MPs David Davis, Oliver Letwin, Bernard Jenkin, John Whittingdale, Graham Brady and Iain Duncan-Smith. Owen Paterson, former environment secretary and Chairman of UK2020, another organisation based at 55 Tufton Street, was also on the advisory board. As of August 2020, the European Foundation had not issued any new publications since July 2019 and its Twitter account had been suspended for violating the media platform's rules. [19], [20], [21], [22], [73], [74]\n",

According to its website, the group promoted “a constructive new relationship between the UK and Europe based on free trade and mutually beneficial cooperation, whilst opting out of the process of political and economic integration”. Its Economic Advisory Panel included Neil Record, Patrick Minford (Chair of Economists for Free Trade) and Eamonn Butler (Founder/Director of the Adam Smith Institute). A now-deleted webpage listed MPs and peers belonging to the “Parliamentary Friends of Global Vision”, which included Bill Cash, Christopher Chope, Philip Davies, Peter Lilley and Lord Vinson. Its “Business Supporters” included oil and minerals businessman Algy Cluff, GWPF donor Michael Hintze, and Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg. As of August 2020, the organisation was listed as active on Companies House however it has filed accounts as a “dormant company” on the website since 2016. In February 2020, a pro-Brexit media outlet named Global Vision was launched by Shanker Singham. It is unclear whether the two organisations are otherwise related. [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [75], [76], [77], [78]\n",

Lord Vinson was another co-founder of the organisation and subsequently served as Director. It regularly publishes work by climate science denier and anti-renewables advocate Rupert Darwall and runs the CapX news and comment website, which has published numerous articles by GWPF members criticising clean energy. Ahead of the UK's adoption of the Climate Change Act in 2008, it published a report casting doubt on climate science and arguing that energy policy should be based on long-term energy security rather than emissions reduction. The group is currently chaired by the billionaire financier and Conservative donor, Michael Spencer, with Sir Graham Brady, Chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, acting as Deputy Chair. More recently the group has published a series of essays from Conservative politicians which called on the party to show leadership in tackling climate change and argued in favour of a carbon border tax. [29], [30], [58], [59], [80], [81]\n",

The group’s president is former Eurosceptic MEP Daniel Hannan, who has downplayed the threat of climate change, believing humanity can adapt to any impacts “with a fractional sum of money”. Originally called the “Institute for Free Trade” before being forced to rename by Companies House, owing to legal requirements around the use of the word “institute”, it published a “blueprint” for a deregulatory US-UK free trade deal in 2018, in partnership with the US-based libertarian thinktank the Cato Institute. A number of long-time opponents of climate action are closely involved in the group, including former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Conservative peer Peter Lilley. The group was previously based at 57 Tufton Street, according to Companies House records. It then moved to 10 Buckingham Street and in February 2020 changed its address to the office of a Birmingham accountancy firm run by Saqib Bhatti, newly elected Conservative MP for the West Midlands constituency of Meriden. [31], [46], [64], [65]\n",
